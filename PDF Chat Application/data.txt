Page 1 of 6Question 1 Background literature
Y ou will have made use of many reference in doing your project. Choose
the TWO most signiﬁcant references that you made use of, and explain:
• what the main idea / point / research contribution of the reference is
• why it was signiﬁcant to your project
• how it inﬂuenced the choices you made in undertaking your project
Also comment on the quality and reliability of the reference.
For each reference, you should identify it by its title and authors, to the
best of your recall. We are not expecting exact referencing here, but
need enough information in order to identify the reference work. [20]

(a) Thinking about all aspects of conducting your project, what is the single
most important lesson you have learned from the experience? Y our
answer should focus on general skills you have developed, rather than
something relating to speciﬁc technical details of this particular project.
Give reasons for your answer. [6]
(b) In the light of the experience you have gained, if you were to attempt
another project of a similar size, in what ways would your approach differ
from how you did things this time?
Y our answer should include a discussion of TWO different aspects of the
project. These may be chosen from the following list, although other
aspects are acceptable too:
• Deﬁning aims and objectives
• Literature review
• Project plan
• Methodology
• Project development
• Testing and evaluation
• Data analysis
• Writing the project report
For each of your chosen three aspects, explain what you felt were the
weaknesses in your current project with regard to that aspect, and how
you would intend to improve them in the new project. [14]
Page 3 of 6���������Question 3 Outcomes
(a) Identify TWO things within your project that you consider to be
signiﬁcant. Y ou can think of this as the two things of which you are the
most proud. For each, describe brieﬂy what it is, and explain and justify
why you consider this to be one of the best things about your project. [14]
(b) Consider any further work that might be appropriate for the project you
have completed. This could be further developing aspects of your
implementation, or doing further research work or data analysis, or
redoing some of what you have done but using a different approach, or
something else.
Describe one such piece of further work, and then describe What advice
would you give to a student who took this on to do a project of their own?
The advice should focus on the topic itself, such as how to go about
dealing with a speciﬁc further question you may have identiﬁed, rather
than on conducting projects in general, such as time management. [6]
Page 4 of 6���������Question 4 Presentation
(a) It is possible to describe the results of a development project or piece of
research in a number of different ways. For example, they can be
presented visually, or they can be presented through descriptive text;
there are also a variety of ot her ways.
Note that for this question, the focus is on the results you described and
discussed in your report.
• Why is it important to present results, and in what ways can they be
pre sented? Include in your discussion a description of how results
are linked to the project aims, and to the conclusions. [8]
• What way did you choose to present your own results? Discuss why
you cho se the approach or approaches you did, and justify their
appropriateness. Also discuss brieﬂy how your results link to your
conclusions. [12]
Page 5 of 6���������Question 5 Development
Part of the process of doing your project would mean that you need to
develop skills and ﬁnd out about areas that you did not already have or
know about.
Choose one subject area, and one skill, that you had to engage with or
develop, in order to undertake your project.
For each one of these:
• describe the area or skill that you did not yet know about or have but
needed to;
• explain why, in the context of your project, you needed to develop this
skill or engage with the subject area; and
• explain how you went about acquiring the new skills and knowledge
required to complete the project.
