Dear
Hiring
Officer
at
ACE,
I
am
writing
this
letter
to
express
my
strong
interest
in
taking
part
in
the
internship
opportunity
at
the
ASEAN
Centre
for
Energy
as
a
Renewable
Energy
Intern
for
the
Feb-May
2024
period.
I
hold
a
Diploma
of
IT
from
Curtin
College
and
am
currently
pursuing
my
bachelor’s
degree
BSc.
Computer
Science
at
University
of
London
through
distance
learning
from
Jakarta;
I
am
in
my
last
semester
and
my
specialization
is
‘Artificial
Intelligence
and
Machine
Learning’.
Throughout
my
studies,
especially
in
the
last
2
semesters
I
discovered,
learned,
and
experimented
with
various
data
science
techniques
and
machine
learning
models.
This
ties
in
well
with
my
other
interest,
which
is
the
dynamics
between
geopolitics
and
the
energy
sector;
I
find
that
these
two
fields
are
very
closely
related
as
the
power
struggle
in
the
world
stage
is
dictated
by
who
controls
the
energy.
I
have
always
been
naturally
interested
in
the
field
of
world
energy.
In
fact,
the
study
case
for
one
of
my
assignments
was
“Using
Linear
Regression
(LR)
Model
to
Predict
Electricity
Price
in
Germany”.
In
brief,
I
aggregated
various
energy
production
and
consumption
data
from
Eurostat
and
trained
a
supervised
machine
learning
model
to
predict
the
price
given
a
set
of
factors
such
as
import,
export,
availability,
etc.
Some
key
findings
of
the
aforementioned
project
includes:
1.
A
satisfactory
LR
model
is
achievable
even
with
limited
data.
2.
At
a
household
level,
there
is
no
correlation
between
energy
consumption
and
electricity
price.
3.
Energy
availability
dictates
energy
consumption.
As
for
communication
skills,
I
am
fluent
in
written
and
verbal
capacity
in
3
languages:
English,
French
and
Bahasa
Indonesia.
I
am
confident
in
my
ability
in
all
3
of
these
languages.
I
find
myself
to
be
a
friendly
person
and
am
always
happy
to
work
in
a
diverse
workplace.
Allow
me
to
reiterate
my
profound
interest
in
this
opportunity
with
the
Asean
Centre
for
Energy.
I
am
always
eager
to
learn
more
in
depth
about
the
energy
sector;
It
would
be
an
honor
to
be
able
to
use
my
skills
and
knowledge
to
further
ACE’s
mission
of
driving
energy
growth
in
South
Asia.
I
have
always
dreamed
of
working
in
an
energy-related
sector,
especially
in
the
context
of
the
region
of
my
home
country.I
look
forward
to
hearing
from
you.
Thank
you
very
much
for
your
time,
attention
and
for
considering
my
application.
Best
regards,
Naufal
